# Swift Function Parameter Label Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: forgetting to include parameter labels when calling functions.

The `bug.swift` file contains code that shows the error. The `bugSolution.swift` file provides the correct usage.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.swift` in Xcode.
3. Try to compile the code.  You will receive a compiler error.

## Solution

The solution is to always include the parameter labels when calling a function, as demonstrated in `bugSolution.swift`.
